Patina is a screen recording tool.

Technically, patina creates a transparent window spanning the entire screen, so that it sees all input events.
Practically, it forwards all input events to the underlying applications as synthetic events, but questions the user about his actions 
through an additional semi translucent chat window.

it captures all mouse and keyborard (input events) and takes screenshots of 
relevant portions of the screen, while a user operates his desktop applications.
'Relevant' in this context is anything that changes, 
and anything that is near the mouse pointer.

When clicking elements on the GUI, patina attempts to identify GUI-Elements. E.g. rectangular areas that change color or move slightly 
after a mouse-click are recorded as belonging to context of the click. Patina saves enough screenshots, so that additional area can easily 
be added to the context later.

The user is encouraged to explain his actions in the patina chat window. Here, patina asks questions about the users actions. Any responses 
are recorded as also belonging to the current context. In this chat window, patina also reports what it sees happening.
The user can comment on this report 'online'. Thus patina can become intrusive
with regard to the users trian of thoughs. On the other hand, the user is free
to ignore all comments and quesitons in the chat window. Patina will always
behave non-blocking.

As an alternate option how to control a GUI, the patina chat offers simple commands, that the user can employ, instead of mouse pointer or keyboard.
Possible commands are: 

Locate "Cancel"
 -> a rectangular highlight is shown around the Cancel button of the most recently opened dialogue.
 -> other feedback is shown, if there are multiple or no such buttons.
Click this.
 -> A normal left mouse button click is performed on the last selected element. 

Goal is a recording session, with enough meta-informations, so that it can be turned into a script.

At the end of a patina session, a skeleton replay script is generated. The more the user worked with patina commands or with correctly interpreted
mouse guestures, the more valuable is this skeleton. A manual review session is typically needed to fine tune the script into a fully functional
gui automation script.

A patina script is a python program. Thus flow control, loops, variables and functions, and other language features can be used to make the script 
efficient.


OCR
---
Technically we need to perform much OCR inside of patina. As of this writing, tesseract appears to be the most advanced linux ocr engine.
cuneiform produced inferior results on tested screen captures.
Artefacts learned during experiments with tesseract:
- Text of normal screen font size does not work. Tesseract starts recongizing text reliably, when the font size is above 20 pixels.
  Thus we have to scale up all screen captures before passing them to tesseract. Then recognition is well in the 99% range. 
- Tesseract often fails to recognize IP-Adresses, short (2 or 3 letter) abbreviations, and unusual punctuation.
- Tesseract can recognize dark text on light backgrounds and light text on dark backgrounds in the same image.
- The segmentation algorithm of tesseract sometimes rotates blocks and assums vertical text. When this happens, there is no hint in the hocr output.
  Such will have the attribiute dir='ltr' just as normal horizontal text has. (Bug?)
- If the image contains multiple areas of text in different colors and on different backgrounds, the recognition quality degrades.
- If there are small (1,2 pixel dark) borders next to text, the result degrades dramatically.
