TestiPy is a technology independent GUI-testing framework, inspired by SikuliX


Name
====
Not sure if the name TestiPy will stick. It is a mashup of test, python, and testify. Somehow I still prefer the name turtlepy, although it means nothing. Reminds of a pie with turtle meat, just as odd as a turtle soup.
