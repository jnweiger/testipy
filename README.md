========

TurtlePy is a technology independent GUI-testing framework, inspired by SikuliX


Name
====
Not sure if the name TurtlePy will stick. It means nothing, but I like it.
Reminds of a pie with turtle meat, just as odd as a turtle soup.
Other suggested names:

 * Specularum	(a city name)
 * SpectaculiX	(the thing that does a spectaculum)
 * SpeculiX	(sikulix with a P for python)
 * Impytus	(gaining pythonic momentum)
 * mirus	(Hans, www.fraenkische-lebkuchen.de, oops, 500.000 hits)
 * cura		(care taker)
 * curapy	(python takes care)
 * idepix	(play on idefix, dog of asterix)

Criteria: 
 - not to easy to misunderstand 
   * curapy -> crappy
   * Specularum -> speculum
 - can be spelled correctly when heard once.
 - currently less than 5000 results on google
 - pronouncable in de,en.
